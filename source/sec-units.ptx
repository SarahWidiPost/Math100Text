  <title>Units and Unit Analysis</title>
<introduction>
  <p> <q>  Scientific progress is measured in 
    units of courage, not intelligence. </q> 
    - Paul Dirac </p>

    Almost all numbers we encounter in day-to-day
      life (news reports, professional data, personal
       finances...) have <term> units</term> 
       attached. The <term> units </term> of a 
       quantity describe what the quantity
     measures or counts. Units tell us how to 
     interpret numbers and give us awareness of scale.
