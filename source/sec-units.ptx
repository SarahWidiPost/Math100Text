  <title>Units and Unit Analysis</title>

 <p> <q>  Scientific progress is measured in units of courage, not intelligence. </q> - Paul Dirac </p>

  <p> Almost all numbers we encounter in day-to-day
     life (news reports, professional data, personal
      finances...) have <term> units</term> 
      attached. The <term> units </term> of a 
      quantity describe what the quantity
    measures or counts. Units tell us how to 
    interpret numbers and give us awareness of scale.  </p>

    <p> <xref ref="ex-units-islands"/> discusses the formation of the 
      Hawaiian Islands and the relation between their age and position
       with respect to their volcanic hot spot. We include all units 
       in the description. </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-units-islands">
      <p> There are eight major volcanic Islands in Hawaiʻi:
      Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi , Lānaʻi, Maui, 
      Kahoʻolawe and Hawaiʻi Island
      <url>https://www.hvcb.org/school-report/eight-major-islands/ </url>. 
      See <xref ref='Fig1'/>

     </p>
      
    <p> In addition, there are several atolls, and numerous smaller islets. 
      It forms what we call an archipelago. Hawaiʻi became U.S. <m> 50^{th} </m> state on 
      August 21, 1959 <url> https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/hawaii </url>, 
      and is the only one not geographically connected to North America.

   <p> The formation of the Hawaiian Islands is occurring via
    Hot-Spot Volcanism. The fixed hot spot at the source of
    the Hawaiian Islands is located in the middle of the
    Pacific Plate, and the chain was formed as the plate
    drifted toward the northwest. Loihi, the youngest
    seamount of the chain is currently erupting from 
    its summit at a depth of 1000 meters. In the 
    following chart we have the age of some Hawaiian
    volcanoes along with their distance from Kilauea:

    This relation is an example of what we call a function 
    which means that for each Island, given as input their
    age in million years we have an output in the form of 
    their distance in km to the Hot Spot. It can be 
    observed that from Table <xref ref="islandsfunction"/> 
    that the Island of Niihau is the oldest one from this
   list being 4.89 million years old and also the furthest
    one from the Hot Spot at 565 km. Koolau, Oʻahu Island, 
    is estimated to be 2.6 million years old and at 339 km 
    from the hot spot.  </p>
