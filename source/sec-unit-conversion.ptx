  <title>Unit Conversion </title>

  <p> There are many units used to measure or count the same quantity: 
    for example, we know that 12 months and 1 year both encompass the same amount of time, 
    while Fahrenheit and Celsius are both units that measure temperature. 
    See <xref ref="fact-unitK"/> to see the same quantities given in different units. 
    To convert between units which scale linearly, we use a <term>conversion factor.</term> 
  </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-conversion-factor">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term> conversion factor </term> is the ratio between two equal 
          units. The known unit is in the denominator and the resulting unit is
          in the numerator. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
  <p> For example, if we would like to convert feet into inches we use the fact
  that 1 foot is the same as 12 inches to obtain the <term> conversion factor </term>
of <me> 1 =\frac{ 12 \mbox{ inches}}{1 \mbox{ foot}}</me>
We can use the conversion factor to change 5 feet into inches: 
<me> 5 \mbox{ feet }\times \frac{ 12 \mbox{ inches}}{1 \mbox{ foot}} =60 \mbox{ inches}</me>
  </p>


   <example> <statement> <p> Kahoʻolawe has a total land area of 44.97 square miles (mi<m>^2</m>).
     What is the area in square kilometers(km <m>^2</m>)? </p> </statement>
     <answer> <p> 116.47 km<m>^2</m></p> </answer>
   <solution> <p> 
    We use the conversion rule between square miles and square kilometers:
     <m> 1  \mbox{ mi}^2 \approx 2.59 \mbox{ km } ^2</m>
      (<m> \approx</m> means that it is an approximation).
       The conversion factor then becomes:
   <me>  1=\frac{2.59 \text{${\rm km}^2$}}{1 \text{mi$^2$} } </me>
    Therefore we have the following:
 <me >
    44.97 \text{mi$^2$} = 44.97 \text{mi$^2$} \times 1 = 44.97 \text{ mi$^2$} \times \frac{2.59 \text{$km^2$}}{1 \text{mi$^2$} }=116.47 \text{km$^2$}\nonumber
 </me>>
    We have obtained that Kahoʻolawe's total land area in square 
    kilometers is given by 116.47 km <m>^2</m>!
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>

<p> It is very important to associate the unit to a 
  measurement to avoid confusion and potentially 
  catastrophic scenarios. Indeed, one of the most 
  famous example of metric math mistake happened on 
  September 23, 1999  when the National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration (NASA) lost the $ 
   125 million Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft after a
  286-day journey to Mars. 
  This was the result of miscalculations due to the use 
  of English units (thrust data were sent in pounds to NASA)
   while NASA's navigation team was expecting metric units
    (Newtons)

  <title> The 2020 Fire </title>
  <introduction>
    <p> 
    During 2020 fire in Kahoʻolawe, see example
    <xref ref="ex-units-islands-kaho"/>, began around 
    9:30 am on February 22 and by 9:30 am on February 29 
    around 9,000 acres had burned.
    </p>
  </introduction>
    <task>
<statement> <p> Over the course of the week, how many 
  square feet were burned? 
  You will need to know that 1 acre = 43,560 square feet </p>
</statement>
<answer>
  <p>
    392,040,000 \mbox{ ft}^2
  </p>
</answer>
<solution>
  <p>
    We use the conversion factor to calculuate
    <me> 9,000 \mbox{ acres} \times 
      \frac{43, 560 \mbox{ft}^2 }{1 acre}= 392,040,000 \mbox{ ft}^2</me>

</solution>
   
</task>   
<task>
  <statement> <p> Over the course of the week, how many 
    square miles were burned? 
    You will need to know that 1 square mile is 640 acres </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>
      14 \mbox{ mi}^2
    </p>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>
      We use the conversion factor to calculuate
      <me> 9,000 \mbox{ acres} \times 
        \frac{1 \mbox{mi}^2 }{640 acre} \approx 14\mbox{ mi}^2</me>

<exploration>
  <statement>
     <p> Many speedometers or gps devices measure pace 
    rather than speed, that is give 
    <em> how many minutes it takes to travel a mile</em>. 
  We will see later <xref ref="ex-na-wahine"/> 
  that the winning
    crew in the 2018 Na Wahine o ke Kai Canoe race had 
    an average speed of about 7.6 miles per hour. 
    What was their pace? </p>
  </statement>
  <hint> <p> Take the reciprocal of miles per hour to get 
    hours per mile. </p>
  </hint>
  <answer> <p>7 minutes and 54 seconds per mile. 
  </p>
  </answer>
  <solution>   <p> If the speed is 7.6 miles per hour,
     then 1 mile = 7.6 hours so their paces was 
  <me> \frac{ 1 \mbox{ hour}}{7.6 \mbox{miles}} =0.13157 \mbox{ hours to go 1 mile} 
  
  </me>
  Turning this into minutes we get 
  <me>\frac{ 1 \mbox{ hour}}{7.6 miles}
     \times \frac{ 60 \mbox{minutes}}{1 \mbox{hour}}=7.89 \mbox{ min per mile}
     </me>
  Or it took 7.89 minutes to go one mile.
  Let's turn the final answer into minutes and seconds. 
  <me> .89 \mbox{min}\times \frac{ 60 \mbox{ sec}}{\mbox{ min}}\approx 54 \mbox{ sec}
  
  </me>
  We conclude that the average pace is 7 minutes and 54 seconds per mile.

<p> Some conversion rules we know instinctively, like 24 
  hours in one day. Others are easily stated, like 
  one milliliter to one cubic centimeter, or common 
  knowledge in specific disciplines,  like 1000 meters 
  to one kilometer. Still others have more complicated 
  conversion rules or formulas. It the for instance the 
  case to convert Fahrenheit into Celsius. In this case,
  we cannot use a <term> conversion factor </term> but 
  instead a more complicated <term> conversion rule </term>
</p>

  <title> Conversion between Fahrenheit and Celcius </title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    The formula to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit is 
    <me> 1^o \mbox{F} =\frac{9}{5}\times 1^o \mbox { C}+32 </me>
    and Farenheit to Celcius is 
    <me> 1^o \mbox{C} =\frac{5}{9}\times( 1^o \mbox { F}-32) </me> 

  </p>
</introduction>
<task> 
<statement> <p> 
  Kahoʻolawe has a yearly average high temperature of 
  24.3<m>^o</m>C. What is its yearly average high 
  temperature in Fahrenheit?
</p> </statement>
<answer> <p> 75.74<m>^o </m> F! </p>
</answer> 
<solution> <p>We use the conversion formula between 
Celsius and Fahrenheit to obtain:
<me> \frac{9}{5}\times 24.3^oC+32= 75.74^oF. </me>
Therefore the yearly average high temperature on 
Kahoʻolawe is 75.74<m>^o </m> F! </p>
</solution>
</task>
<task> 
  <statement> <p> 
    The average low temperature in the winter on Kahoʻolawe
     is 65<m>^o</m>F. What is this temperature in Fahrenheit?
  </p> </statement>
  <answer> <p> 18.3 <m> ^o C </m> </p>
  </answer> 
  <solution> <p>We use the conversion formula between 
   Fahrenheit and Celcius to obtain:
  <me> \frac{5}{9}\times (65 -32) \approx 18.3^o C. </me>
  Therefore the average low temperatures in the winter are 
  around 18.3 <m> ^o C </m>
  </p>
  </solution>
  </task>
<conclusion> <p> 
  The Fahrenheit scale was first proposed in 1724 
  by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit 
  while the Celsius scale was developed in 1742 by 
  Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (originally the 
  scale was in the opposite order with 0<m> ^oC</m> being 
  the boiling point of water, and 100<m>^oC</m> 
  the freezing point). Based on D.G. Fahrenheit's scale, 
  scientists noted that the difference between boiling 
  and freezing water was nearly 180<m>^o</m>, and 
  readjusted the scale to be exactly 180<m>^o</m>. 
  That's how human body temperature moved from 96<m>^oF</m>
   to 98.6<m>^oF</m>.
