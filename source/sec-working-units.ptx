  <title> Working with Units </title>
  <p> In this section we provide examples of problems for
   which to derive the solution we need to use units and 
   unit conversion. </p>

<p> When solving problems with units it is good to 
  remember some guiding principles: 
<ul>
  <li> It helps to make an educated guess 
    (maybe by approximation, maybe based on general
     knowledge), to check how `reasonable' the final 
     answer is. </li>
<li> Identify the units of the inputs, and of the outputs:
   use this to guide you with what to do, and stop you 
   making mistakes like adding two quantities with 
   different units.  </li>
  <li>Finish by comparing your answer to your assumptions. </li>  Does your answer look reasonable?  In a real life problem, what factors might alter the solution?
</ul>

  <title> Reintroducing native plants on the Island of Kahoʻolawe
  </title>
  <introduction>
    <p> Due to limited funding and the scope of the work,
       the restoration of Kahoʻolawe is heavily dependent
        on the work of volunteers. 
    </p>
 <p> Although the number of individuals who volunteer is 
  plentiful, only a small number can travel to Kaho'olawe 
  every year. A critical preparation is that they must 
  go through training with the Kaho`olawe Island Reserve 
  Commission (KIRC) before they travel. Usually there are 
  about two trips to the island every month, with each
   trip typically spanning a few days.
    </p>
    <p> 
      As of fiscal year 2019, the KIRC reintroduced 459,878 plants 
      to the island over the course of 16 years. We 
      solve below some questions associated to this fact 
      to understand the needed number of volunteers that 
      it required. </p>
  </introduction>
  <part>
    <statement>
   <p>  On average, it can be estimated that a volunteer 
    can properly plant about 50 trees a day. 
    How many days would be needed for a single volunteer
     to plant the 459,878 plants that KIRC has reintroduced?
      How many years does it represent?</p>
   </statement>
   <solution> <p> 
    We first divide the total number of plants to be 
    planted by the number of plants that the volunteer 
    can plant in one day:
    <me> 459,878 \mbox{ plants } \times \frac{1 \mbox{ day}}{50 
     \mbox{ plants}}=9,198 \mbox{ days to plant}. </me>
   Assuming there is 365 days in a year we convert the number in days to years as follow:
    <me> 9,198 \mbox{ days} \times \frac{1 \mbox{ year}}{365 
     \mbox{ days}}=25.2 \mbox{ years}. </me></p>

     <p>As a conclusion, for a single volunteer it would take 
     9,198 days non stop, which is equivalent to 25.2 years
      non stop, to realize the work KIRC has done in 
      16 years (note that KIRC is limited with the number 
      of days per year it can bring volunteers to the 
      island to reintroduce plants).</p>
    </solution>
  </part>
  <part> 
    <statement>
      <p>  Since a single volunteer is not realistic, 
        we are now trying to understand the number of 
        volunteers needed in a more realistic scenario.
         Based on the fact that volunteers spend on average
          4 days on the Island, how many volunteers are
           needed to plant the the 459,878 plants?</p>
      </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
    <me> 9,198 \mbox{ days} \times \frac{1 \mbox{ volunteer}}
      {4  \mbox {days}}=2,299 \mbox{ volunteers needed total}
     </me>

    </p>
  </solution>
